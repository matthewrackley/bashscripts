# Bash Scripts

* Potentially useful bash scripts made to provide: 
	- A more organized structure
	- A teaching tool
	- Maybe even just a neat little artpiece.
* Please Read through if there is any potential info you might need to use
* These scripts are not guaranteed to be posix compliant. 
	- They have only been tested on Debian and Kali..

## More scripts will eventually come along.
	Below is the Current List of Scripts.
	*They have been ordered based on date of Creation*
		1. BUPS/Vim Wrapper
		2. clrmetxt

## Script Explanation and What they do
	1.**BUPS/Vim Wrapper**
		*This is a wrapper for vim which provides a simple backup system* 
		*Each file type is given it's own folder in the user's home directory*
		*It is clunky code and is definitely able to be improved upon.*
		*As of current it suit's my needs and uses*
	2.**ClrMeTxt**
		*This is more of an artsy coding markdown design template.*
		*It's main focus is on colorizing what you type*
		*It turns what you type into a neat little html paper.*
